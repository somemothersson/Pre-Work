    <h2>Too Country for LA, Too Rock n' Roll for Nashville</h2>

    <p>Gram Parsons' charred body was found dumped out of a casket along the side of the road in Joshua Tree National Park. The fulfillment of promise made between Gram and his manager Phil Kaufman. Gram is perhaps one of Rock n' Roll's most intrigueing characters. 
        Despite being unknown to most, he created what has become one of the most popular styles of music heard today, refered to as <b>Country Rock</b>. Gram often showed his distaste for this name and instead refered to his style of melding Country, Rock n' Roll, R&B.
        These attributes can be clearly comprehended upon a listen to any of his records, that he dubbed <b>Cosmic American Music</b>. A man of such Charisma that his addition to the Byrds changed the band's direction from Dylan covering Jangle Pop, to recording an album of
        mostly country standards in Nashville. He befriended Keith Richard's of the Rolling Stones and his influence can be heard clearly in <b></b>Exile on Mainstreet
    </p>

    <p>By the time of his pre-mature death at 27 he was behind many of the mainstream's favorite records
